# Aumni SQL Coding Challenge

Visit the Stack Overflow Data Exchange at: https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/edit/1388536
In the right-hand pane you will see the schema for the Stack Overflow database. All of the columns you'll need to perform these queries are in the Posts and Users tables.
Note: The Stack Overflow Data Exchange is a SQL Server database

Please provide your query that answers each of these questions
1. What is the score of the post with the ID 4?
2. What is the day of the week with the most posts created?
3. What is the lastAccessDate and displayName of the 5 posters with the most posts created?
4. Building upon the answer to question 3, return those rows with the addition of the CreationDate of the oldest and newest posts created by those top 5 users.
5. How many posts would it take to reach the 90th percentile of users?
