# Aumni Backend Coding Challenge

The purpose of this coding challenge is to gauge knowledge in Ruby/Rails. In the coding challenge you will build a Ruby on Rails application that contains a very small subset of our domain at Aumni. Below you will find some helpful terminology to help you understand what these domain specific terms mean.

## Terminology

- **Fund** - A Fund is a type of [Investment Vehicle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentvehicle.asp) that invests the money that it has raised into various **Companies**.

- **Company** - A Company that a **Fund** invests in. Traditionally called a Portfolio Company from the perspective of the **Fund**. This is typically a start-up company that is trying to raise money.

- **Equity Financing** - Is a round of funding when stock is issued by the **Company** to **Fund**s investing in the **Company**. A **Company** can have multiple **Equity Financing** rounds in which multiple **Fund**s can invest. A **Fund** can invest in the same **Company** in multiple **Equity Financing**s.

- **Investment** - A generic term used for simplicity in the coding challenge. A **Fund** can invest in a **Company** in myriad ways, but for simplicity, we are just contemplating a simple transaction whereby a **Fund** purchases shares in a **Company** for a certain amount of dollars during an **Equity Financing**.
